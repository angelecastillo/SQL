#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Netflix data to answer questions about the data.

#1. Combine the two tables to see the show ID, director, title, and type.
SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id; 

#2. How many movie titles are in the database? (only movies, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#3. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
select max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#4. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#5. Who was the Director of the movie Bright Star?
SELECT people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#6. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year DESC 
LIMIT 1;
